# Gesture-Hand-Painting
Gesture Hand Painter is a Python-based application that enables users to draw using hand gestures detected via a webcam. Built with OpenCV and MediaPipe, this project allows color selection, brush strokes, and an eraser mode that activates when the palm is fully open. Ideal for interactive art and AI-driven gesture control demonstrations.
